class WebSocketScope(TypedDict):
    """Websocket Connection Scope

    WebSocket connections’ scope lives as long as the socket itself - if the
    application dies the socket should be closed, and vice-versa.

    The connection scope information passed in scope contains initial connection
    metadata (mostly from the HTTP request line and headers):

    Attributes:
        type (Literal["websocket"]): The message type.
        asgi (ASGIVersions): The version of the ASGI spec.
        http_version (str): One of `"1.1"` or `"2"`. Optional; if missing
            default is `"1.1"`.
        scheme (str): URL scheme portion (likely `"ws"` or `"wss"`). Optional
            (but must not be empty); default is `"ws"`.
        path (str): HTTP request target excluding any query string, with
            percent-encoded sequences and UTF-8 byte sequences decoded into
            characters.
        raw_path (bytes): The original HTTP path component unmodified from the
            bytes that were received by the web server. Some web server
            implementations may be unable to provide this. Optional; if missing
            defaults to `None`.
        query_string (bytes): URL portion after the ?. Optional; if missing
            default is empty string.
        root_path (str) – The root path this application is mounted at; same as
            `SCRIPT_NAME` in WSGI. Optional; if missing defaults to empty
            string.
        headers (Iterable[tuple[bytes, bytes]]): An iterable of `[name, value]`
            two-item iterables, where name is the header name and value is the
            header value. Order should be preserved from the original HTTP
            request; duplicates are possible and must be preserved in the
            message as received. Header names must be lowercased. Pseudo headers
            (present in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3) must be removed; if `:authority` is
            present its value must be added to the start of the iterable with
            host as the header name or replace any existing host header already
            present.
        client (Optional[Tuple[str, int]]): A two-item iterable of
            `[host, port]`, where host is the remote host’s IPv4 or IPv6
            address, and port is the remote port. Optional; if missing defaults
            to `None`.
        server (Optional[Tuple[str, Optional[int]]]): Either a two-item iterable
            of `[host, port]`, where host is the listening address for this
            server, and port is the integer listening port, or `[path, None]`
            where path is that of the unix socket. Optional; if missing defaults
            to `None`.
        subprotocols (Iterable[str]): Subprotocols the client advertised.
            Optional; if missing defaults to empty list.
