"""HTTP

The HTTP format covers HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, as the changes in HTTP/2
are largely on the transport level. A protocol server should give different
scopes to different requests on the same HTTP/2 connection, and correctly
multiplex the responses back to the same stream in which they came. The HTTP
version is available as a string in the scope.

Multiple header fields with the same name are complex in HTTP. RFC 7230 states
that for any header field that can appear multiple times, it is exactly
equivalent to sending that header field only once with all the values joined
by commas.

However, RFC 7230 and RFC 6265 make it clear that this rule does not apply to
the various headers used by HTTP cookies (`Cookie` and `Set-Cookie`). The
`Cookie` header must only be sent once by a user-agent, but the `Set-Cookie`
header may appear repeatedly and cannot be joined by commas. The ASGI design
decision is to transport both request and response headers as lists of 2-element
'[name, value]' lists and preserve headers exactly as they were provided.

The HTTP protocol should be signified to ASGI applications with a `type` value
of 'http'.

    """HTTP Connection Scope

    HTTP connections have a single-request connection scope - that is, your
    application will be called at the start of the request, and will last until
    the end of that specific request, even if the underlying socket is still
    open and serving multiple requests.

    If you hold a response open for long-polling or similar, the connection
    scope will persist until the response closes from either the client or
    server side.

    Attributes:
        type (Literal['http']): The message type.
        asgi (ASGIVersion): Version of the ASGI spec.
        asgi (Union[Literal['2.0', Literal['2.1']]]): Version of the ASGI HTTP
            spec this server understands; one of "2.0" or "2.1". Optional; if
            missing assume 2.0.
        http_version (str): One of "1.0", "1.1" or "2".
        method (str): The HTTP method name, uppercased.
        scheme (str): URL scheme portion (likely "http" or "https"). Optional
            (but must not be empty); default is "http".
        path (str): HTTP request target excluding any query string, with
            percent-encoded sequences and UTF-8 byte sequences decoded into
            characters.
        raw_path (bytes): The original HTTP path component unmodified from the
            bytes that were received by the web server. Some web server
            implementations may be unable to provide this. Optional; if missing
            defaults to None.
        query_string (bytes): URL portion after the ?, percent-encoded.
        root_path (str): The root path this application is mounted at; same as
            SCRIPT_NAME in WSGI. Optional; if missing defaults to "".
        headers (Iterable[tuple[byte string, byte string]]): An iterable of
            [name, value] two-item iterables, where name is the header name,
            and value is the header value. Order of header values must be
            preserved from the original HTTP request; order of header names is
            not important. Duplicates are possible and must be preserved in the
            message as received. Header names must be lowercased. Pseudo headers
            (present in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3) must be removed; if :authority
            is present its value must be added to the start of the iterable with
            host as the header name or replace any existing host header already
            present.
        client (Optional[tuple[str, int]]): A two-item iterable of [host, port],
            where host is the remote hostâ€™s IPv4 or IPv6 address, and port is
            the remote port as an integer. Optional; if missing defaults to None.
        server (Optional[tuple[str, Optional[int]]]): Either a two-item iterable
            of [host, port], where host is the listening address for this
            server, and port is the integer listening port, or [path, None]
            where path is that of the unix socket. Optional; if missing defaults
            to None.
        state (Optional[dict[str, Any]]): A copy of the namespace passed into the
            lifespan corresponding to this request. 
        extensions (Optional[dict[str, dict[object, object]]]): Optional server
            specific extensions.

    Notes:
        Servers are responsible for handling inbound and outbound chunked
        transfer encodings. A request with a chunked encoded body should be
        automatically de-chunked by the server and presented to the application
        as plain body bytes; a response that is given to the server with no
        `Content-Length` may be chunked as the server sees fit.
