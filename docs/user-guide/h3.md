# HTTP/3 - QUIC

## Overview

Upgrading to HTTP/3 is straightforward. It requires:

- an ASGI server which supports is (e.g. [Hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/))
- [TLS incryption](ssl.md)

There is currently very little browser support for this. I was able to demonstrate
that it was working with a nightly build of FireFox on Ubuntu 20.04 following
[these](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-test-http-3-and-quic-with-firefox-nightly/)
instructions.

## Example

The following code launches a web server which supports:

- http on port 80
- https on port 443
- https using http/3 on port 4433

A browser that is capable of switching to http/3 will automatically upgrade
the https connection.

As this example uses "standard" ports you will need to run the server with
**sudo**.

Note the `quic_bind` line.

```python
"""Example server"""

import asyncio
import logging
import os

from bareasgi import Application, HttpResponse, text_writer
import bareutils.response_code as response_code
from hypercorn.asyncio import serve
from hypercorn.config import Config

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

async def http_request_callback(request):
    text = """
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is not a test</p>
  </body>
</html>
"""
    headers = [
        (b'content-type', b'text/html'),
        (b'content-length', str(len(text)).encode())
    ]
    return HttpResponse(response_code.OK, headers, text_writer(text))

app = Application()
app.http_router.add({'GET'}, '/{path}', http_request_callback)

config = Config()
config.insecure_bind = [ '0.0.0.0:80' ]
config.bind = [ '0.0.0.0:443' ]
config.quic_bind = [ '0.0.0.0:4433' ]
config.keyfile = os.path.expanduser('~/.keys/server.key')
config.certfile = os.path.expanduser('~/.keys/server.crt')

asyncio.run(serve(app, config))
```
