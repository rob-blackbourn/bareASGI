# Lightweight ASGI Web Framework

This is a web framework for [ASGI](user-guide/asgi) servers in Python 3.8.

The goal is to provide a minimal implementation, with other facilities (serving
static files, CORS, sessions, etc.) being implemented by optional packages in an
attempt to keep the implementation clear and lightweight.
