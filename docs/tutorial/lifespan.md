# Lifespan

Lifespan events occur when the server starts up and shuts down.

On startup they can be used for initialization, or for starting long running
tasks. On shutdown they can clean up resources and provide graceful termination.

You can find the ASGI documentation
[here](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/lifespan.html).

The source code for the following example can be found
[here](../examples/lifespan_nt.py)
(and here [here](../examples/lifespan.py) with typing).

## Handlers

The following code creates an application with a startup and shutdown handler.

The handlers simply log a message.

```python
import asyncio
import logging

import uvicorn

from bareasgi import Application, text_writer

async def on_startup(request):
    print("Running startup handler")

async def on_shutdown(request):
    print("Running shutdown handler")

app = Application(
    startup_handlers=[on_startup],
    shutdown_handlers=[on_shutdown]
)

uvicorn.run(app, port=9009)
```

We can add the handlers at any point before the application starts (or stops
for shutdown handlers).

```python
app = Application()
app.startup_handlers.append(on_startup)
app.shutdown_handlers.append(on_shutdown)
```

We could have used a decorator instead.

```python
app = Application()

@app.on_startup
async def on_startup(request):
    print("Running startup handler")
```

### LifspanRequest

The request parameter is of type `LifespanRequest`.

This has the following fields

#### Scope

The `scope` field contains the unmodified ASGI scope defined
[here](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/lifespan.html#scope).

It doesn't contain much that's useful, but I pass it for completeness.

#### Info

The `info` field contains the data that is shared across the application.

This is typically used to retrieve configuration, and store resources.
